# Capstone1: Ordinary Apparel
QUICK RECAP: I had to re-do this entire project from my original. My first Website that I created crashed. I had it private and did not submit commits accordingly so when that happened, the best way to go about it was to restart from scratch. It was a very frustrating process but many lessons learned along the way.
